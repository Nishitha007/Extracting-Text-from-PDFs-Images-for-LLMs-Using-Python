# Extracting-Text-from-PDFs-Images-for-LLMs-Using-Python
This repository demonstrates a Python-based solution for extracting text from PDFs and images to preprocess data for Large Language Models (LLMs). It leverages popular libraries like PyPDF2 and Tesseract-OCR to ensure accurate text extraction and preprocessing for downstream tasks such as fine-tuning, training, or inference in LLMs.
