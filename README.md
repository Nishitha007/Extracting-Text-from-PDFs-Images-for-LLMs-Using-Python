# Extracting-Text-from-PDFs-Images-for-LLMs-Using-Python
This repository demonstrates a Python-based solution for extracting text from PDFs and images to preprocess data for Large Language Models (LLMs). It leverages popular libraries like PyPDF2 and Tesseract-OCR to ensure accurate text extraction and preprocessing for downstream tasks such as fine-tuning, training, or inference in LLMs.
Features:

Extract text from PDFs (both text-based and scanned).
Perform OCR on images to extract text with high accuracy using Tesseract.
Preprocess extracted text for compatibility with LLMs.
Batch processing for handling multiple PDFs or images simultaneously.
Language detection and optional text translation for multilingual datasets.
Easy-to-use script with customizable options for extraction and preprocessing.
Technologies Used:

Python
PyPDF2
pytesseract
Pillow
pdf2image
langdetect (for language detection, optional)
Use Cases:

Preparing text datasets for fine-tuning LLMs.
Extracting text from scanned documents for digitization.
Automating text extraction workflows in AI/ML pipelines.
